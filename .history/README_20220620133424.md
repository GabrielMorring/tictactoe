# Overview

I tried to make a online tictactoe game where you can play with your friends. You can run this on your computer by opening both the client and server in different vs code workspaces and typing npm start into both. You can then view the game in the browser on localhost:3000.

I wrote this just for fun and to try to learn a bit about how online multiplayer games work.

# Web Pages

There is only one web page, which is the tictactoe game page. It kind of looks like two pages because there is a login part, but that is the same page

# Development Environment

vs code and a web browser were all i needed to develop this

the language i used was javascript. I used react and tailwindcss for the frontend and i used node, express, and socket.io for the backend.
